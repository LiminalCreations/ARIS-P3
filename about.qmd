ARIS is an NSF-funded center for "Advancing Research Impacts in Society". In January 2022, Liz Neeley and Francisco Guerrero were awarded an ARIS Fellowship to develop an ambitious project that brings together: relational aspects of community building, strategic aspects of engagement, and tactical dimensions of information transfer.

Francisco J. Guerrero is the Science and Communication Research Associate for the Integrated, Coordinated, Open, and Networked-[ICON](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/icon-science) Science Cooperative at PNNL. He is a watershed ecologist and a science communicator. 
since 2004, Francisco has been studying land to ocean carbon fluxes in small mountainous river systems. In his parallel role as communicator (since 2014), he has designed and implemented communication infrastructure (workshops, panels, working groups facilitation, etc.) at research-driven organizations from regional to national levels (e.g. universities, state agencies, and national research centers). Currently, Francisco is creating workflows for scientists and knowledge workers to integrate strategic communication tools along the scientific production lifecycle (from ideation to publication).
