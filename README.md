# ARIS-P3
ARIS is an NSF-funded center for "Advancing Research Impacts in Society". In January 2022, Liz Neeley and Francisco Guerrero were awarded an ARIS Fellowship to develop an ambitious project that brings together: relational aspects of community building, strategic aspects of engagement, and tactical dimensions of information transfer. 

# What is this?
We named this framework **P3 = PEOPLE, Products, and Platforms**. The term “PEOPLE” doubles in meaning here as an acronym for _Points of Engagement Or Points for Leveraging Engagement_.

We aim to develop a soft communication infrastructure that could be used by individuals, teams, and even organizations. In brief, that looks like a combination of two things: curated resources to help combat information overload and answer the question, "Where do I find guidance on how to...?" plus guiding questions to help users make decisions and build action plans for how to work on them. 

# How will you be able to use it?
1. **Download the materials as a PDF.** We're using Bookdown to format the package, and know that some people may just want a simple document they can save, reference, and share. 
2. **Fork the repo and integrate a copy into your lab manual** We've been inspired by [Gavin Faye's lab manual](https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Quick-steps-to-making-a-copy-of-the-lab-manual-&-publishing-it) and are excited to build on it! 
3. **Build with us** Similarly, we are inpsired by [Julie Lowndes and the entire OpenScapes team](https://github.com/Openscapes) Ultimately, we believe an open science approach is the best way forward. The work of curating resources and connecting theory to practice will massively benefit from being able to develop this together. We'd love to hear from you!

# When will it be ready?
Our fellowship ends December 2022. We are planning for alpha release in Q3 2022.
