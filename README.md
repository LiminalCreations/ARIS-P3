# ARIS-P3
ARIS is an NSF-funded center for "Advancing Research Impacts in Society". In 2022, Liz Neeley and Francisco Guerrero were awarded an ARIS Fellowship to develop an ambitious project that brings together:
1. relational aspects of community building, 
2. strategic aspects of engagement, and 
3. tactical dimensions of information transfer. 

We are calling this framework **P3 = PEOPLE, Products, and Platforms**. The term “PEOPLE” doubles in meaning here as an acronym for _Points of Engagement Or Points for Leveraging Engagement_.

We aim to develop and implement a soft communication infrastructure for team science that could be used by individuals, teams, and even organizations.
